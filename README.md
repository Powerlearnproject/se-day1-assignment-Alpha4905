#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the application of engineering principles and techniques to design, develop, maintain and test the software system.  software engineering is very Cardinal in the technology industry on the grounds that it ensures quality. software meets requirements and is reliable efficient and maintainable. time bound. software meets project due schedules and delivering software on tine. software engineering is important for cost effective, it manages developmental and cost and resources 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. waterfall methodology, this first structured  approach to software development. it introduced a linear, phase by phase approach to software development emphasizing requirements gathering, design testing e.t.c.
2. Agile methodology. This revolutionarized software development by introducing iterative, incremental and flexible approaches. it emphasized Customer satisfaction, team collaboration, adaptive planning e.t.c
3. DevOps and continuous everything (2010). This marked a significant shifts towards integration of development and operations teams, automation of testing and deployment and monitoring.
   these milestones represent significant advancements in software engineering.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. planning. define project scope, goals, timeline, budget and resources
2. Requirements gathering. collect and document user needs qnd expectations
3. Analysis. Breakdown requirements into smaller building blocks, identify patterns and relationships.
4. implementations. write the software codes in a programming language.
5. Testing. verify that the software meets requirements, works as expected and is free of all defects.
6. Deployment. install, configure and deliver the software to end users.
7. Maintenance. update, modify and expand the software to ensure continued performance and relevance.
8. Evaluation. assess the software's success, gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
These are two popular software development methodologies that are distinct in their approach, philosophy and Application 
Waterfall Methodology. Sequential, linear approach,, phases completed one after another, Emphasis on predictability, stability and control. change resistant, as changes can be costly and time consuming.
Agile Methodology. iterative, incremental approach phases, overlap, and cycles repeat ( planning, execution, evaluation) emphasis on flexibility, adaptability and continuous improvement. welcomes change , with a focus on quick response and iteration.
scenarios where each would be applicable.
waterfall 
predictable projects with clear requirements 
safety critical systems e.g aviation and healthcare Regulatory environments e.g finance government. small projects with fixed scope and timeline.
Agile.
projects with uncertain or changing requirements. innovative or experimental projects, fast paced environments e.g start, tech. large , complex projects with multiple stakeholders.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer is responsible for writing code and implenting software solutions. Quality assurance ensures software quality by making and executing test plans. as for a project manager oversees the plans , execute and deliver a software project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
they provide comprehensive tools for writing codes, debugging and testing codes emg eclipse, visual studio e.t.c VCS is used for tracking changes to source codes and coordinating work among team members e.g git subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
tight deadlines, have enough time to work on the software to avoid compromise and mideocre works. technical debt to avoid making unnecessarily shorcuts. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing, integration testing, system testing help to identify and fix defects early in the development process leading to higher quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
AI prompt is crafting questions in a clear manner to get a clear cut answer from an AI.
it's important because it gives specifications to questions asked.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"what is 2pm EAT in CAT?" "convert for me the time 2PM EAT to CAT. EAT is East African time while CAT is central African time. this question needs an answer in time zone.
